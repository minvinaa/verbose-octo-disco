        <p class="text-muted">You know what's awesome? Our school's basketball court! It's this big, open space where we
          can bounce and shoot basketballs. The court's got these cool lines all over, and there's this giant hoop at
          each end. You can't miss them ‚Äì they're like the target for all the basketball fun!

          During breaks, my buddies and I rush to the court to play. We split into teams and take turns dribbling and
          passing the ball. The best part? Trying to make that perfect shot and hearing the swish when the ball goes
          through the hoop. It's like a victory dance every time!

          I'm not the tallest player, but that doesn't stop me from having a blast. We all cheer each other on and have
          mini competitions to see who can make the most shots. And guess what? Sometimes our teachers join in too! It's
          hilarious to see them try to shoot from way far away.

          Oh, and remember that time we had a mini basketball tournament? It was epic! Different teams from our class
          played against each other, and it was so exciting. We ran around, dribbled like crazy, and high-fived like
          champions. My team didn't win, but we still got a shiny badge for trying our best.

          The basketball court is like a place where we can hang out, be active, and learn new tricks. And you know
          what? Even if we miss a shot or fumble the ball, we just laugh it off and keep playing. That's what makes it
          so much fun!</p>

        <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Tennis Court</kbd></h4>
        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-capitalize text-success">It established in 1949</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">You won't believe how cool our school tennis court is! It's like a mini sports place right
          here in our school. When you walk by, you can see people playing tennis with rackets and hitting that little
          ball back and forth.

          The court is all green with lines on it, and there's a net in the middle. It's like a challenge to get the
          ball over the net and make sure it bounces in the right spot on the other side. It's not as easy as it looks,
          but it's super fun.

          Sometimes during recess, my friends and I go to the court. We take turns hitting the ball and trying to see
          who can hit it the farthest. And when we actually hit it over the net, it feels like a big win! We're not
          pros, but we're getting better each time we play.

          There's this one teacher who knows a lot about tennis, and sometimes they come and show us some tricks. They
          teach us how to hold the racket and how to stand so we can hit the ball just right. It's like having a secret
          coach.

          I really like the tennis court because it's a place where we can have fun and learn at the same time. Maybe
          one day, I'll be really good at tennis and play like those players on TV. But for now, I'm just enjoying
          playing with my friends and getting better bit by bit.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">You won't believe what happened ‚Äì I totally won the inter-house chess championship at
        school! üèÜ I wanted to
        tell you the whole story because it was like a chess roller coaster.

        So, each house had its own chess team, and we all played against each other. I was representing my house, and I
        was so excited and a bit nervous too. But you know what? I really love chess, so I was ready to give it my best
        shot.

        In the first game, I played against a friend from another house. We both moved our pieces carefully, trying to
        outsmart each other. It was like a mind puzzle, and I had to think about my moves a lot. I managed to capture a
        few of their pieces, and suddenly I was in a strong position. I was feeling like a chess wizard!

        As the games went on, I played against different kids from different houses. Some games were quick, and some
        were super long because we kept protecting our kings. But I kept using what I learned about openings and tactics
        to my advantage.

        Finally, it was down to the last game. I was up against a tough opponent from another house. It was a really
        close game, and we were both trying to outwit each other. But then, I saw a move ‚Äì a move that would put their
        king in a spot where they couldn't escape. It was like a secret plan unfolding!

        I made the move, and they couldn't believe it. Their king was trapped, and they had no moves left. I had won the
        game and the whole championship! üéâ My housemates cheered, and our house leader was so proud of me.

        I got a shiny medal, and my friends carried me on their shoulders (well, not really, but they were super happy
        for me). It felt amazing to win something I love doing so much. Chess is like a puzzle battlefield, and I'm so
        glad my strategies paid off.

        Can't wait to play more chess and have more epic victories!</p>

      <p class="text-muted">You won't believe it ‚Äì I scored big in the second inter-house football match at school! üèÜ I
        just had to tell you about all the soccer excitement.

        So, all the houses had their teams, and we played against each other in this awesome football tournament. I was
        part of our house's team, and we were all super pumped. The field was huge, and the goalposts looked so far
        away!

        In our first match, I played as a forward. It was kinda nerve-wracking because the other team was good, but I
        was ready to run and kick that ball. I had practiced dribbling and shooting a lot, and this was my chance to
        show what I could do.

        During the game, I got a pass from a teammate, and I dribbled past a defender ‚Äì it felt like I was flying! Then
        I kicked the ball super hard, and guess what? It went straight into the net! GOAL! ü•Öüéâ Everyone cheered, and my
        team high-fived me like crazy. It felt like a dream!

        We played more matches, and in each one, I gave it my all. Sometimes I was in defense, trying to stop the other
        team from scoring. Other times, I was in the midfield, passing the ball to my teammates and running like
        lightning.

        In the final match, we were up against a really strong house. It was a tough game, but we didn't give up. I
        played my heart out, dribbling, passing, and even making a few awesome saves as a goalie! We scored a goal too,
        and the game ended in a tie.

        Guess what? We ended up in second place because we scored more goals throughout the tournament. Even though we
        didn't get the big trophy, I was so proud of our team. It was like a big soccer adventure, and I made new
        friends and got better at playing.

        My housemates cheered for us like we were champions, and I got a medal that I wear proudly. Football is like a
        dance with the ball, and I'm excited to keep practicing and playing more games.</p>
